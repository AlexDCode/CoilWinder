## Introduction
The goal of the project is to develop an automatic coil winding machine using commands via the serial communication.

This is just a place to store and share source code, images, and important references for documentation.

Place the source code inside the src folder, the libraries for the code in the lib folder, media files in the assets folder, and other documentation at the docs folder.
